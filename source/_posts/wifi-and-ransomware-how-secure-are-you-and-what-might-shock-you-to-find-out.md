Ransomware is a type of malware that locks you out of your computer until you pay a ransom. In most cases, the ransom is paid in Bitcoin. Recently, there has been a surge in ransomware attacks, and many people are wondering how to protect themselves from them.

In this blog post, we will answer the question: can ransomware spread through WiFi?

## Who Does Ransomware Target?

Ransomware targeting is not discriminate. It can target anyone at any time. However, there are certain groups of people who are more likely to be targeted by ransomware.

For example, businesses are often targeted by ransomware because they have more money to pay the ransom. Healthcare organizations are also often targeted because their data is valuable and they can’t afford to lose it. Also, individuals who have personal information that is valuable to criminals are at risk of being targeted by ransomware.

## How Does Ransomware Spread?

Ransomware can spread in a number of ways. The most common way is through email attachments. Attackers will send an email with an attachment that appears to be harmless, but when the victim opens it, the ransomware is installed on their computer.

Ransomware can also spread through websites that have been infected with malware. When you visit an infected website, the ransomware can be downloaded onto your computer. This is why it’s important to only visit websites that you trust.

## Can Ransomware Spread Through WiFi?

The short answer is yes, ransomware can spread through WiFi. However, the chances of this happening are very low.

The reason why the chances of this happening are low is that ransomware needs to be downloaded onto a computer in order to work. In order for that to happen, someone would need to connect to your WiFi network and then visit an infected website or open a malicious email attachment.

While it is possible for this to happen, it’s unlikely. If you’re worried about someone connecting to your WiFi network and infecting your computer with ransomware, you can use a VPN. A VPN will encrypt your traffic and make it more difficult for someone to snoop on your network.

## How Does Ransomware Spread Over WiFi?

Malicious programs and files tend to spread through networks, and since WiFi is also a network, cyber attackers use it as a medium to infect every device in its contact. If one device in a WiFi Network catches a virus, others automatically become vulnerable to it. But if other devices have a robust security solution installed on them, they can resist the attack and stay secure.

Take an example of a biological virus. When a person is infected with a virus, it gets spread to others through the air when the infected person is in close range. In this case, the infected person is a host, and the air is a medium, just like WiFi. In this case, also, the person with good immunity can resist the attack and stay secure.

Let me just list out the steps how ransomware can be spread through a WiFi Network:

1. The hacker exploits the weak network and finds security loopholes in a device to infect it with a malicious program or file.
2. The intruder initiates the ransomware spread to other devices using the infected device as a host and WiFi as a medium.
3. Most other devices in the network without a security program would get infected with the malware without any action from their side.
4. After the ransomware is dropped on the devices, it will start doing what it was meant for.
5. Even if you disconnect from the rogue network, the ransomware will still remain on your device. WiFi was just a medium.

## How to Prevent Malware Attacks Through WiFi?

Now that you know that ransomware and other malware can spread through WiFi, it becomes essential to follow security measures to prevent attacks on your device through WiFi.

Follow these tips to stay protected:

* Never connect to an open public WiFi network. Most of them are weakly encrypted or not encrypted at all.
* If you have to connect to public WiFi because of urgency, never do that without enabling the VPN. A VPN can hide your private information and secure your privacy while on unsecured networks.
* Keep the WiFi of your device disabled when not in use. Also, disable the auto-connect option.
* Never share your sensitive information on sites without SSL certificates. To verify whether the site has an SSL certificate, check its URL. [If it starts with HTTPS, it is secured with an SSL](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). If it is just [HTTP](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), it is unsecure.
* Disable the file-sharing feature and app on your device when not in use.
* Make sure that your device’s Firewall is always turned ON to keep an eye on your network.
* Keep a robust security solution installed on your gadgets to [remove malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) in case it gets infected.

**Can a WiFi router be infected with malware?** 

YES. Using modern attacking techniques, cyberattackers can infect a WiFi router with malware. They can use it to monitor the network as a third party or infect other systems connected to the network.

**Can your home WiFi get hacked?** 

It is possible to hack a home WiFi network in various ways. Cybercriminals can do that by hacking tools or easily look up the default password associated with a given type of router and use it to access countless devices. Hackers can also exploit the security flaws in the router’s firmware.
