Most Dangerous

## How to remove Scareware and Screen Lockers

Usually, these can be found in the list of Software programs installed on your computer. You can uninstall them manually from the list.In case, name is not listed, you should use proven anti-malware solution like MalwareFox.It will detect and remove such nuisance programs and also look up for any other infection on system.

Encrypting Ransomware is toughest to deal with. If computer data is encrypted, it cannot be fixed using any tool. Hackers use military grade encryption algorithm which can only be decrypted with a unique key.

## 3 Ways to Remove Ransomware Encryption

### 1\. Restoring Backups

* This is applicable if you have taken backup of important data on separate local drive or cloud storage.
* Copy the backed up data on a storage disk and confirm it isn’t affected by looking for encrypted files.
* Also, scan this disk with proven anti-malware program like MalwareFox possibly on unaffected computer.
* Format the affected disk with encrypted data and restore the backed up data safely.

### 2\. Using Decryption Tools

Most of the ransomware encryption techniques have been recognized owing to their popularity. As a result, decryption tools have been developed which can rescue data without paying ransom. For this, you have to identify the ransomware affecting your PC.This software, when matched with correct ransomware family, can decrypt your files for free.

* Visit [](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)[NoMoreRansom.org](https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.php)
* Identify the type of ransomware by uploading ransomware note, email or web address.
* If they are able to identify, you will be provided with a solution in next step.

There is, however, a problem. Not all ransomware families have had decryptors created for them, and in many cases, people are unable to create decryptors because the ransomware is utilizing advanced and sophisticated encryption algorithms. Then, even if there is a decryptor, it’s not always clear if it’s for right version of the malware. You don’t want to further encrypt your files by using the wrong decryption script.

Alternatively, you can visit [ID Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/) by the [Malware Hunter Team](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam) and upload the ransom note or one of your encrypted files and it will tell you exactly what you are dealing with. After that, you can either enter the name of the ransomware and ‘decryptor’ into a search engine and you should hopefully find some good results.

### 3\. Negotiating

OK, you neither have backups elsewhere nor the decryptor for your ransomware is available. In such case, only solution is to pay the criminals to claim your data. However, there is a catch. You don’t always have to pay the demanded amount (read: heavy).

You can pay them smaller amount to get files back. To do that, contact them on the given email address or send message via contact form about negotiation. They simply want money and for them something is better than nothing. So, chances are high that they will decrypt it for small amount of profit.

To be absolutely clear, we do not endorse or support paying cybercriminals the ransom. However, it has to be understood that for some folks, the loss of files would be far more damaging than just paying the ransom fee.

## How to protect myself from Ransomware?

* Always Backup your Data.The most important step you can take to secure your system against ransomware is to regularly perform a system backup to safeguard your valuable data.
* Avoid spam emails. Do not open suspicious email attachments and links.
* Update your OS & software regularly. Patch and maintain your operating system, anti-malware, firewall, Adobe Flash Player, Java, browsers, and keep other software up-to-date.
* Use strong passwords. Reduce the risk of identity theft by setting up unique passwords for different accounts.
* Notice a suspicious process on your PC? Turn off the Internet connection instantly. This way ransomware won’t get the chance to start a connection with its C&C server and cannot complete the encryption process.
* Use anti-malware software and a firewall. Run a real-time anti-malware remediation tool and setup a strong firewall protection.
