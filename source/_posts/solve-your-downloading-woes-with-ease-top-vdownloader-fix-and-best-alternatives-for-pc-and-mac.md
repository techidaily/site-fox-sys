## Solve Your Downloading Woes with Ease: Top Vdownloader Fix & Best Alternatives for PC and Mac

### Overview

If you are a Vdownloader user and you are not aware of since when you have run into some Vdownloader not working issues. You are not alone in this issue. Let's see some other Vdownloader not working issues I collected in the Vdownloader forum:

* _When I try to download videos from Vimeo I always get the error message: "Unable to obtain required initial information about this video"._
* _Why can not download videos from adult sites any more? I am running the Vdownloader Plus version._
* _When I try to download a playlist from YouTube I get the message "Playlist is empty and can not download". Why? Vdownloader can not download YouTube playlist?_
* _I failed to download the first video after I installed Vdownloader and the error message was "This is not a valid video URL", but it is indeed a video. Why?_
* _After the video was downloaded the video would be converted automatically, but the converted video is far worse than the original one. How can I stop the automatic converting?_
