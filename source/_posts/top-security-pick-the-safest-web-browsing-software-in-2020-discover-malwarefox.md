Naturally, you want your browser to be secure and best in handling the privacy for safely conducting those activities. 

Currently, the most popular internet browser is undoubtedly Google Chrome. It is leading with humongous 60+% of all internet users across all platforms. But can you trust Google for providing online privacy? The answer is simply NO.

Though Chrome is the most widespread browser, it cannot be considered as privacy securing one. In fact, it is a data collection tool. Everything you search for or everything that goes through Google Chrome is saved to your profile, and the collected data is used for targeting advertisements. 

The same goes for another popular browser Microsoft Edge.

In this guide, we would discuss who are the most genuinely secure web browsers for ultimate privacy.

## What must a Secure Browser have?

If you are a regular internet user, you might know that a browser contains a lot of personal pieces of information like:

* Login Credentials for many websites that you saved for faster login authentication. Including the bank account and Debit/Credit card details.
* Private information like Name, Phone Number, Address, and other to autofill the forms.
* Browsing history of all the websites you visited and the searches you conducted on the search engine.
* Cookies and trackers for enhanced web experience

If not handled properly, these pieces of data can be exploited heavily, and if handed to the third-parties, they can use it in any way.

A secure browser should : 

* be the one that can protect all your information
* provide full control to users on what they want to share and what they don’t
* be transparent with its users. It should tell users what data it is collecting and how it would use it.
* include other security functions like URL filtering, no tracking, and secure download
* provide users the option to opt-out from data collection.
* include additional web-extensions or plugins if the user requires the added security.

### **Tor Browser**

![Tor Browser](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tor.png)

The number third in our list is the Tor Browser, which is popularly associated as the browser to get access to the [Dark Web](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Tor is more than just a browser. It is a package that provides you the anonymity as well as security while browsing. Tor does not save anything, not even bookmarks, and cookies. It also works as a VPN and navigates all your searches or web visits through a virtual server, making it hard to track.

However, in providing maximum privacy, Tor loses too much browsing and downloading speed, making it highly latent and unfit for daily or regular use.

## What are the Problems with other Browsers?

Many browsers claim to be best in speed, user interface, resource use, and other features, but highly lacks in providing secure and private browsing experience. In the name of providing an enhanced and super fast web experience, they collect many unusual system data. Following are the problems with the other popular browsers:

* A maximum of them is data collecting tools for targeting advertisements.
* Mostly, they are closed source, so we don’t know what is happening in the background.
* Browser like Opera collects a lot of information like Device ID, Hardware Configuration, Operating System, and feature usage data.
* Apple was caught hoarding Safari browsing data, EVEN after they were deleted. It also collects history even in private mode.
